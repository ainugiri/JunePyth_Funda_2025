Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and decision-making.

Artificial : Man made / not naturally occurring.
Intelligence: The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.
    1. Think, Learn, Reason, Problem Solve, Perceive, Communicate.

AI System:
 Mimic human cognitive functions.
 Machine will interact with the environment, generate responses, and learn from experiences.

 1. Learning from data
 2. Understanding natural language
 3. Recognizing images and speech
 4. Making decisions

 1. Rule Based AI: 
    - Uses predefined rules and logic to make decisions.

2. mACHINE Learning:
   - A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.
   - Types of Machine Learning:
     1. Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data.
     2. Unsupervised Learning: The model finds patterns in unlabeled data.
     3. Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by receiving feedback from its actions.

3. Deep Learning:
    - Special form of ML, but it uses Neural Networks

Neural Networks:
    # age, noofkms, owners, mileage, fueltype, -> features
    # input layer -> hidden layers -> output layer
    in input layer -> input features
    neurons / nodes

    w.r.t. features values, it will redirect to another neuron in the next layer. And also it will have weights. 

    Inside the neuron, it will have an activation function.
    Mathmeatically, it will be a linear equation.
    - Activation Function: Determines whether a neuron should be activated or not based on the input it receives.
    - Common activation functions include:
      1. Sigmoid: Outputs a value between 0 and 1.
      2. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): Outputs the input directly if it is positive; otherwise, it outputs zero.
      3. Tanh: Outputs a value between -1 and 1.

      Based on the output of the activation function, it will redirect to the next layer.

NLP: 
    - Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.
    - It involves understanding, interpreting, and generating human language in a way that is valuable.
    - Applications include chatbots, language translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.


AI + Linguistics + CS -> NLP (Natural Language Processing):

    Understand, interpret, and generate human language.

    Ex: Hey Siri, Set an alarm for 7 AM tomorrow.
    1. Understand -> intent -> set an alarm
    2. Interpret -> extract entities -> time, date
    3. Generate -> response -> "Alarm set for 7 AM tomorrow."

    How does it work?
    if you provide a sentence, it will break it down into tokens (words).
    - Tokenization: The process of breaking down text into smaller units, such as words or phrases.
       - sentence_tokenization: Breaking down a sentence into words.
       - word_tokenization: Breaking down a sentence into words.
    - Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Assigning grammatical categories to words in a sentence, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
    - Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities in text, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and more.
    - Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.
    - Language Generation: Creating human-like text based on input data, such as generating responses in a conversation or summarizing text.

    : NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a popular library in Python for working with human language data. It provides tools for tokenization, POS tagging, NER, sentiment analysis, and more.
    

    Python:
     popular programming language for AI and NLP.
     create windows, web applications, ML, Data Science, and AI applications.
     Basics: 
        - Variables,
        - Data Types (int, float, str, list, dict, set, tuple),
